                Sample:. (Chapter 1
The sound of heavy footsteps thump down the hallway of an abandoned house as the floorboards creak under Thanatras’s feet. 
“What is that, no one could have gotten past the guards could they?” a man mumbled. 
The door flew open as Thanatras walked in “Them guards were weak they didn’t stand a chance.” Thunder Edge sparked lightly with electric energy as the thunderbolt on its side is half full.
Smirking the man stood “Ha I know you, you're that guy who doesn’t have magic, that means you're too weak to stop me fool now you, die.” laughed the man. The man pulled his weapon from his side and unleashed a blast of electricity at Thanatras as he deflects it with his sword, the thunderbolt on it fills a bit more. Thanatras rushes forward lunging his blade at the man as the wizard quickly forms a wall of ice trapping Thunder edge as two thugs run at Thanatras jumps into the air kicking one of them into the wall then spins around back handing the other before grabbing Thunder edge once more as the bolt loses its coloring and a devastating bolt of electricity jolts from the blade into the wizard's chest killing him as the mage falls to the ground his magic wall is dispelled and Thanatras places Thunder edge onto his back and starts walking back down the hallway.
	As Thanatras walks out of the old house he looks around the alleyway spotting Kalazar leaning on the barrels loading a cartridge of bullets with fire bolts as his wolf “Gold” walks around a puddle of water. “What are you doing here Kalazar?” Thanatras asks. 
“Making sure no one got away.” Kalazar retorted. ~)
