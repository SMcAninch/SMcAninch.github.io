           The sound of heavy footsteps thump down the hallway of an abandoned house as the floorboards creak under Thanatras’s feet. 
“What is that, no one could have gotten past the guards could they?” a man mumbled. 
The door flew open as Thanatras walked in “Them guards were weak they didn’t stand a chance.” Thunder Edge sparked lightly with electric energy as the thunderbolt on its side is half full.
Smirking the man stood “Ha I know you, you're that guy who doesn’t have magic, that means you're too weak to stop me fool now you, die.” laughed the man. The man pulled his weapon from his side and unleashed a blast of electricity at Thanatras as he deflects it with his sword, the thunderbolt on it fills a bit more. Thanatras rushes forward lunging his blade at the man as the wizard quickly forms a wall of ice trapping Thunder edge as two thugs run at Thanatras jumps into the air kicking one of them into the wall then spins around back handing the other before grabbing Thunder edge once more as the bolt loses its coloring and a devastating bolt of electricity jolts from the blade into the wizard's chest killing him as the mage falls to the ground his magic wall is dispelled and Thanatras places Thunder edge onto his back and starts walking back down the hallway.
	As Thanatras walks out of the old house he looks around the alleyway spotting Kalazar leaning on the barrels loading a cartridge of bullets with fire bolts as his wolf “Gold” walks around a puddle of water. “What are you doing here Kalazar?” Thanatras asks. 
“Making sure no one got away.” Kalazar retorted. 
“Yeah sure you were, we should head back to the council's keep and turn in this bounty.” Thanatras grunts. 
“Money does sound pretty good.”Kalazar nods in agreement, they both walk down the dark and murky alley. After a short time of walking they get to the grand arcane silver gate that flickers with magic as they swing open and the spell breaker knights kneel down to Thanatras and Kalazar they walk down the stone path to the door.
“The Volgeth have gone too far they must be wiped off this world!” mumbles a Council member, The door clunk open. “Ah Thanatras how did your hunt go?” the Council leader asks. “It went well I was not able to capture them and was forced to slay them.” Thanatras said. “Well at least you are safe and you were able to get those thugs out of our city.” The council leader said before frowns looking down to Kalazar “What did you do to aid in this mission?” Kalazar smirks before saying “I watched the alleyway and made sure no one got away.”  he give a light smile to the council leader “After all we wouldn’t want what happened at the Volgeth burrow.”
The whole council shouts in anger “That doesn’t give you the right to not do your job we will not pay you for nothing now then. Thanatras we have a new mission for you starting tomorrow you are to report to the northern command to help combat the Volgeth.” As they finish speaking a file floats from next to the large table landing in Thanatras’s hands as he opens the folder reading over the reports. 
Thanatras looks up from the file “Where are you sending Kalazar the report is saying it's a one man mission?” as he looks over to Kalazar who started to play with his gun before saying “Don’t worry about me Thanatras believe it or not I am stronger than you, hey old man” Kalazar yells to the council leader. “Where are you sending me?”
“We are sending you down south to the goblin's expanse we need you to lead the human rebellion and the mercenary group we hired to lead as lieutenants down there, you will lead as the commander with you power it shouldn’t be a problem.” After a short pause “Oh and take that mutt with you we don’t need it in our city.” The Council leader said quickly
	Gold growls at the council leader as its starts to bare fang three spell breakers run over surrounding them. Their plate armor clanking together as they start to take battle stances, Kalazar holds his hand up waving down his pet wolf but keeps his gun aimed at one of the guards.“Well this is enough festivities for one day.” Kalazar looks up to the council leader “Dad I will set out tomorrow, I will send word when the goblins are pushed back to the cost.” Kalazar turns on his heel to face the door as Gold follows behind as Kalazar walks toward the door he loads one shot into his gun firing it at the wooden door as a beam wave fires from the barrel of his gun making the grand wooden door shatter to small splinters then flies past all of the guards the wind gust knocking them off balance hitting the arcane silver gate making the metal doors fly from the large walls down the road after the beam dissipates Kalazar can be seen running next to Gold as he vanishes into the town while the guards start to pursue him before the council leader yells for them to stand down.
