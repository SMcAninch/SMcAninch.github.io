            Chapter 1
The sound of heavy footsteps thump down the hallway of an abandoned house as the floorboards creak under Thanatras’s feet. 
“What is that, no one could have gotten past the guards could they?” a man mumbled. 
The door flew open as Thanatras walked in “Them guards were weak they didn’t stand a chance.” Thunder Edge sparked lightly with electric energy as the thunderbolt on its side is half full.
Smirking the man stood “Ha I know you, you're that guy who doesn’t have magic, that means you're too weak to stop me fool now you, die.” laughed the man. The man pulled his weapon from his side and unleashed a blast of electricity at Thanatras as he deflects it with his sword, the thunderbolt on it fills a bit more. Thanatras rushes forward lunging his blade at the man as the wizard quickly forms a wall of ice trapping Thunder edge as two thugs run at Thanatras jumps into the air kicking one of them into the wall then spins around back handing the other before grabbing Thunder edge once more as the bolt loses its coloring and a devastating bolt of electricity jolts from the blade into the wizard's chest killing him as the mage falls to the ground his magic wall is dispelled and Thanatras places Thunder edge onto his back and starts walking back down the hallway.
	As Thanatras walks out of the old house he looks around the alleyway spotting Kalazar leaning on the barrels loading a cartridge of bullets with fire bolts as his wolf “Gold” walks around a puddle of water. “What are you doing here Kalazar?” Thanatras asks. 
“Making sure no one got away.” Kalazar retorted. 
“Yeah sure you were, we should head back to the council's keep and turn in this bounty.” Thanatras grunts. 
“Money does sound pretty good.”Kalazar nods in agreement, they both walk down the dark and murky alley. After a short time of walking they get to the grand arcane silver gate that flickers with magic as they swing open and the spell breaker knights kneel down to Thanatras and Kalazar they walk down the stone path to the door.
“The Volgeth have gone too far they must be wiped off this world!” mumbles a Council member, The door clunk open. “Ah Thanatras how did your hunt go?” the Council leader asks. “It went well I was not able to capture them and was forced to slay them.” Thanatras said. “Well at least you are safe and you were able to get those thugs out of our city.” The council leader said before frowns looking down to Kalazar “What did you do to aid in this mission?” Kalazar smirks before saying “I watched the alleyway and made sure no one got away.”  he give a light smile to the council leader “After all we wouldn’t want what happened at the Volgeth burrow.”
The whole council shouts in anger “That doesn’t give you the right to not do your job we will not pay you for nothing now then. Thanatras we have a new mission for you starting tomorrow you are to report to the northern command to help combat the Volgeth.” As they finish speaking a file floats from next to the large table landing in Thanatras’s hands as he opens the folder reading over the reports. 
Thanatras looks up from the file “Where are you sending Kalazar the report is saying it's a one man mission?” as he looks over to Kalazar who started to play with his gun before saying “Don’t worry about me Thanatras believe it or not I am stronger than you, hey old man” Kalazar yells to the council leader. “Where are you sending me?”
“We are sending you down south to the goblin's expanse we need you to lead the human rebellion and the mercenary group we hired to lead as lieutenants down there, you will lead as the commander with you power it shouldn’t be a problem.” After a short pause “Oh and take that mutt with you we don’t need it in our city.” The Council leader said quickly
	Gold growls at the council leader as its starts to bare fang three spell breakers run over surrounding them. Their plate armor clanking together as they start to take battle stances, Kalazar holds his hand up waving down his pet wolf but keeps his gun aimed at one of the guards.“Well this is enough festivities for one day.” Kalazar looks up to the council leader “Dad I will set out tomorrow, I will send word when the goblins are pushed back to the cost.” Kalazar turns on his heel to face the door as Gold follows behind as Kalazar walks toward the door he loads one shot into his gun firing it at the wooden door as a beam wave fires from the barrel of his gun making the grand wooden door shatter to small splinters then flies past all of the guards the wind gust knocking them off balance hitting the arcane silver gate making the metal doors fly from the large walls down the road after the beam dissipates Kalazar can be seen running next to Gold as he vanishes into the town while the guards start to pursue him before the council leader yells for them to stand down.

“Well Kalazar I will be getting on the supply caravan heading north, please be safe on the south front.” said Thanatras, Kalazar Waves Thanatras off dismissively “I will I will, just don’t get yourself killed up there I can promise you that not everyone will use thunder magic.” Kalazar quickly runs over to his horse that was set off to the side away from the gates jumping onto it quickly as it rushes off down the road Gold chasing after him Thanatras climbs onto the back of the wagon as the caravan leader motions for the the group to follow yelling back “Sir Thanatras feel free to take a nap we will be there in the next day or so.” as Thanatras nods entering the wagon and sits down.

While riding through the forest Kalazar comes to a cross road as he looks down the left path from his right Gold starts to growl at the sound of hoofs thumping down the road as they come into the clearing the three people upon the back of large stags, one clade in silver plate armor with golden trimming, another with scaled armor a large bow on his back around a dark leather quiver and the final one in dark robes with a beast at the side of her mount. “Oi who are you lot?” as Kalazar speaks the man in plate lowers the hood from his head revealing golden spiked hair and his long ears pop up “I am Tylan’lein Dawnblade we are traveling to the Human front against the Goblin forces, we were hired by the human council to support their forces.” Kalazar nods “Well I am the human commander being sent there as well we can travel together if you like.” Tylan nods throwing his hood back up nodding “Then we should get moving, Commander Kalazar.” Kalazar nods patting his horse as they gallop down the road he looks back to them “So what are your powers just so I know what I will be working with?”
Tylan-”I fight with light magic to enhance my attacks and heal.”

The other man removes his hood “I am Kozin Trueshot, my magic power is to create and mold arrows out of extremes of energy.” as he forms a arrow of fire in his hand then makes it vanish with a spark of violent energy. The girl next to him lowers her hood “I am Lorna Duskcarnation my magic power is to twist nether energies to my will that is how I control this beast.” she points down to the dark monstrosity walking next to her. Kalazar nods quickly “Nice to meet you both and I can tell you are strong, I was going to ask about that thing but it's best if I don’t know.”
	The small group enters a clearing while they charge across it they can see Goblin war tanks launching molten stones towards a small fortress with large stone walls armed with bow men matched with two towers that had built in cannons, as they ride into the center of the small fort then they rush into the barracks as Kalazar enters the war room he places his gun on the table “Report, how are our men doing?” the sergeants snap too “Um well, our forces have been pushed back to our walls by them war tanks.” Kalazar looks back to Lorna “I need you to go use your dark magic on them tanks to push them back we need to get all wounded troops back into the barracks.” Lorna nods and runs out of the room with the dark monster running after her, looking down at the table he spins the map to facing him “Do we have any intel on them?” the sergeant points to a skull on the map “That is where their commander is he goes by the name of Sin Netherfang a dark goblin with blood red eyes he has control of a very dark magic power called nethermancy when he stepped into power this war got turned around in no time at all.”
Kalazar nods to the sergeant “I was put into commander here by the council.” he then turns and walks over to the wall and looks onto the battlefield as he spots Lorna walking onto the battleground and the cannons aim at her when they all fire a dark red aura encircles her and the bullets bounce from a shield then she raises her right hand as dark portals surround her and dark claws fly from it punching through the tanks ripping the goblins from them before she slams them into the ground a shadow ball flies from behind the goblin line splinting the connections while a dark goblin walks forward and yells “You are strong Nethermancer girl, oh and tell then new commander welcome to the game.” the goblin lets out a dark crackle walking back into his basecamp.
Kalazar with a fierce look on his face mumbles “So that was my enemy, we will plan a counterstrike after I address our forces, Kozin, Tylan’lein go stand outside the barracks, Sergeant lead the way.” the Sergeant nods “Yes sir.” then leads Kalazar to a room with a balcony above the courtyard as Kalazar looks over the edge, Tylan and Kozin walk from the front of the large castle standing on the steps then yells down to the refugees and militia forces “The Human council has sent me here to lead you in the battle to take back your homes, the vile goblins think you are weak and will just given to their rule but they did not account for your spirit now we will take up arms and combat them on the front lines we will push them back to their beach, I know you are all not battered warriors but if you would please declare your magic type so I know what I have to work with.” after he finishes talking a torrent of cheers sounds from the crowd along with some people shouting their magic type “Enhancement!” “Casting!” Kalazar throws up his hands yelling down “Now if you are Enhancement stand over with the Knight on my right.” as he motions to Tylan who is standing tall over the militia, “If you are casting stand next to the ranger on my left, and anyone who is a healing class please stay in the middle.” as the groups split from each other. Lorna rides back into the fortified hill from the battlefront.

Thanatras climbs from the back of the waggon to the to the sound of horns and heavy drums bellowing out side as the caravan enters a large encampment scattered with tents and in the center a large fortified tower stands scorched and rugged, Thanatras standing in amazement looking around as his eyes spot a lone knight covered in thick plate armor walks from the battlefield his armor painted with blood and deep lacerations the knight's eyes seemed to burn with a light aura then his eyes catch Thanatras’s and he gives a light smile before walking into the worn tower, the caravan guide yells back “Unpack the supplies!” the other members of the travel pack start to pull down the extra tents and medical supplies, Thanatras jumps down from the waggon walking over to a group of warriors “Hello where is the commander at I was sent by the council to aid in the war.” the warriors let out a rugged laugh “Hey boys we have a new blood, I bet he can’t last a day here.” the other warriors still laughing then point him over to the large tower, Thanatras nods before spitting down at their feet then runs off to the tower and walks in to find the towers inside was nothing more than a one floor command center the way to the upper floors cut off by what look like cannon fire that shattered the stairway, Thanatras looks around before spotting the knight in a dark blue robe with gold outline focusing on a map “Hello, I’m Thanatras sent from the Council to aid in the war.” the knight looks back then points over to a chair “Sit.”
“Are you the commander?” Thanatras asks as he sits down he draws his great sword leaning it against the wall behind him. The knight looks at him “I am Trydin Dracoshock Templar and commander of the northern expedition force, you will call me Trydin nothing else do you understand!” his voice booms louder than the drums that were playing as he entered the encampment making him jump before saying “Yes sir I...I mean Trydin.” Trydin laughs “Okay kid, the next battle is tomorrow morning, when you see an elf in dark armor walk into the battlefield don’t engage him he is my target.” Thanatras look at Trydin with a confused look on his face “You will be on the frontlines Trydin, that's not how commanders normally act.” Trydin draws a line on the map. “Other commanders are weak I would never hide in the back while my men are out on the battlefield dieing, I give orders from the front you don’t need to obey them but I have never lost a knight on and I will not start now.” Thanatras nods “I will go get ready for battle sir.” Trydin smiles then goes back to studying the map drawing on it and moving props into and off the map as Thanatras exits the tower looking into the darkened sky watching the stars before walking away from the other camp groups setting up his tent and starting his fire.
